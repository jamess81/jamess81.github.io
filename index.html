<p>Override default styles to a predictable value using the “universal” CSS
selector (*) resetting the margin and padding properties, as well as setting
all our boxes to border-box, which is best practice:</p>

<code>* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code>



<p>&lt;head&gt; tags contain all meta data</p>

<p>&lt;body&gt; tags contains all visible element of page</p>


<p><strong>Block elements</strong> are always drawn on a new line</p>

<p><strong>Inline elements</strong> can affect sections of text anywhere within
  a line</p>


<p><strong>Absolute links</strong> contain a full web address</p>

<p><strong>“Relative”</strong> links point to another file in your website from
   the vantage point of the file you’re editing. It’s implied that the scheme
   and domain name are the same as the current page, so the only thing you need
   to supply is the path.</p>

<p><strong>“Root-relative”</strong> links are similar to the previous section,
  but instead of being relative to the current page, they’re relative to the
  “root” of the entire website.</p>


<p>These days, UTF-8 is sort of like a universal alphabet for the Internet.
  Every web page you create should have this line in its &lt;head&gt;.</p>

<p>There are three <strong>reserved characters</strong> in HTML: &lt; &gt;
  and &amp;. You should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>

<p>The &lt;link/&gt; element is just like the &lt;a&gt; element, but it’s
  only meant to be used inside of &lt;head&gt;. Since it’s in the head of
  the document, &lt;link/&gt; connects to metadata that’s defined outside of
  the current document. Also notice that it’s an empty element, so it doesn’t
  need a closing tag.</p>

<p>It’s usually a good idea to use root-relative paths when linking global
  stylesheets to avoid problems in nested pages. For example,
  some-folder/page.html would need to use ../styles.css to reference our
  styles.css file, and this can get real confusing real quick.</p>


<p><strong>The CSS hierarchy</strong> for every web page looks like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The browser’s default stylesheet</li>
  <li>User-defined stylesheets</li>
  <li>External stylesheets (that’s us)</li>
  <li>Page-specific styles (that’s also us)</li>
  <li>Inline styles (that could be us, but it never should be)</li>
</ul>

<p>Headings are <strong>block elements</strong>, paragraphs are blocks, too.
  <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
   elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>

   <ul>

     <li><p><strong>Block boxes</strong> always appear <strong>below</strong> the
       previous block element. This is the “natural” or “static” flow of an HTML
       document when it gets rendered by a web browser.</p></li>

     <li><p>The <strong>width of block boxes</strong> is set automatically based
       on the width of its parent container. In this case, our blocks are always
       the width of the browser window.</p></li>

     <li><p>The default <strong>height of block boxes</strong> is based on the
       content it contains. When you narrow the browser window, the
       <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> gets split over two lines, and its height adjusts
     accordingly.</p></li>

     <li><p><strong>Inline boxes</strong> don’t affect <strong>vertical
         spacing</strong>. They’re not for determining layout&mdash;they’re for
       styling stuff <em>inside</em> of a block.</p></li>

     <li><p>The <strong>width of inline boxes</strong> is based on the content it
       contains, not the width of the parent element.</p></li>

   </ul>

<p>Turn &lt;a&gt; elements into buttons or format &lt;img/&gt; elements by
  <strong>defining them as block elements</strong> (both of these are inline
  boxes by default).</p>

<p>The <strong>“CSS box model”</strong> is a set of rules that determine the
dimensions of every element in a web page. It gives each box (both inline and
block) four properties:</p>

<ul>

	<li><strong>Content</strong> &ndash; The text, image, or other media
		content in the element.</li>

  <li><strong>Padding</strong> &ndash; The space between the box’s
		content and its border.</li>

  <li><strong>Border</strong> &ndash; The line between the box’s padding
    and margin.</li>

  <li><strong>Margin</strong> &ndash; The space between the box and surrounding
  boxes.</li>

</ul>

<img src='css-box-model.png' width='500' class="center" alt='Css box model'/>

<p><strong>Margins define the space outside of an element’s border</strong>.
  Or, rather, the space between a box and its surrounding boxes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The padding of a box has a background, while margins are always
    transparent.</li>
  <li>Padding is included in the click area of an element, while margins
    aren’t.</li>
  <li>Margins collapse vertically, while padding doesn’t.</li>
  <li>One of the starkest contrasts between block-level elements and inline
    ones is their handling of margins. Inline boxes completely ignore the top
    and bottom margins of an element.</li>

</ul>

<p>A quirk of the CSS box model is the “vertical margin collapse”. When you
   have two boxes with vertical margins sitting right next to each other, they
   will collapse. Instead of adding the margins together like you might expect,
    only the biggest one is displayed.</p>

<p>Both &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are <strong>“container”</strong> elements
  that don’t have any affect on the semantic structure of an HTML document.
  They do, however, provide a hook for adding CSS styles to arbitrary sections
  of a web page.</p>

<p>The width and height properties <strong>only define the size of a box’s
  content</strong>. Its padding and border are both added on top of whatever
  explicit dimensions you set.</p>

<img src='box-sizing-content-box.png' width='500' class="center" alt='Css box model'/>

<p>When you set the left and right margin of a block-level element to auto,
  it will <strong>center the block in its parent element</strong>.</p>

<p>The CSS <strong>type selector</strong> selects all elements of the given type
  within a document.</p>

<p><strong>Class selectors</strong> let you apply CSS styles to a specific HTML
  element. They let you differentiate between HTML elements of the same type.</p>

<p>When there’s two conflicting properties in a CSS file, the <strong>last one
  is always the one that gets applied.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Descendant selectors</strong> let you target only those elements that
   are inside of another element. For example, we can pull out that &lt;em&gt; in the
  .synopsis paragraph with the following:</p>
  <code>
  .synopsis em {
    font-style: normal;
  }
</code>

<p>The most common <strong>link pseudo-classes</strong> are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>:link</strong> – A link the user has never visited.</li>
  <li><strong>:visited</strong> – A link the user has visited before.</li>
  <li><strong>:hover</strong> – A link with the user’s mouse over it.</li>
  <li><strong>:active</strong> – A link that’s being pressed down by a mouse (or finger).</li>
</ul>
